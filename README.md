# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Classification-Problem

This project utilizes a marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution whose dataset we found on UCI Machine Learning Repository which aims to analyze and predict a model that will fit the best for the bank's marketing campaign. Some customers were selected, their data like age, marital status, loan, etc. were gathered and then contacted by phone calls. Since the prediction is whether the client will subscribe or not, several classification techniques like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic regression were used in order to determine if the client will subscribe for a term deposit based upon various attributes. Also, feature selection was done to identify the list of predictor variables that would affect the response variable. Last, all three models were compared using accuracy as well as confusion matrix to see which one fits the best.
